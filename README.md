# Recipe-App
Recipe Web Application built using Node.JS, Express, React, MongoDB Atlas, and Spoonacular API. 

Involves User Account Authentication, CRUD operations for Local Recipes and API Recipes, a Favorites List. Also includes UI features like dark mode, shopping list, pantry feature. 

This is my first university group project where I participated in a group of 5. 

My biggest contributions were towards the backend where I wrote the Models for Recipes and Users, CRUD functionality, and set up the database. I also helped in setting up the intial HTML UI templates where users could perform CRUD operations on recipes.
