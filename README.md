# Recipe-App
Full Stack Recipe Web Application built using MERN Tech Stack, MongoDB Atlas, and Spoonacular API.

Product Description:  
Full stack web application for users to create, read, delete, and update recipes. Incorporates a REST API to grab recipe information from Spoonacular API, user login details, and local recipe information. Also incorporates a database to store/save recipes by user.

Product Technologies:
- Mern Tech Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database)
- Spoonacular API (Third-party Food API)
- MongoDB Compass (Database Management Tool)
- Postman API (Backend Testing)

Product Features:
- User account creation/deletion to save and create recipes.
- Search recipes using different query parameters (title, cuisine, diet, ingredients) through Spoonacular API, local database including other users' recipes, and your own saved recipes.
- Create, Read, Delete, and Update (CRUD Operations) recipes locally as well as RUD Spoonacular Recipes.
- Save local recipes including other users' recipes and Spoonacular recipes into Saved Recipes/Favorites page.
- Print and download any local or Spoonacular recipe to your PC.
- Grocery List that can hold a list of items that can be saved or printed.
- Pantry page that conveniently allows you to search for recipes using whatever ingredients you have.
- Dark Mode feature to allocate towards user experience and interface (UI/UX).    

My contributions:
- Project File and Database Setup. I researched how to organize project files, what packages and dependencies are needed, and how to deploy the Cloud database. 
- Backend Initialization. I created the routes, Models, and Schemas regarding the User and Recipe information. I also set up how and what User and Recipe data will be stored in the database. Tested the connectivity and functionality using Postman API. 
- Frontend Initialization / Website Setup. Initial design and template of the different web pages (home, create-recipes, and saved-recipes). 
- CRUD Operations. Designed and implemented functionality for users to be able to create, read, delete, and update recipes locally as well as delete and update Spoonacular recipes. Worked parallelly along with website setting up website to test functionality. Managed Recipe and User data using MongoDB Compass to ensure frontend was working with backend. 
- Save Recipes. Designed and implemented functionality for users to able to save local and Spoonacular recipes across website. Also tested using MongoDB Compass.
